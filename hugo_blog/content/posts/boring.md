Feel so boring in this pandemic quarantine.

Working with competitive programming in the summer vaction.
It's really hard.
And I got bamboozled by Windows.

Newline in Windows would make a '\r' in the end in the input buffer
while Linux only put a '\n' in the end.
This gave me a lot of problems while I'm testing code with file input.

Pain.
